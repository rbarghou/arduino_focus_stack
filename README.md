# Arduino Focus Stack

## Disclaimer
This is a prototype, please feel free to fork, but do so at your own risk.

## Overview
This project allows for the control of a simple motorized focus rail system.

This has been designed with minimum abstraction and minimum architecture to allow for the proof of concept and very basic applications to be attained with minimum design work.

This code is highly integrated with a very specific design.  There has been no work put into generalizing the code or making it fit different configurations.  This is deliberate, but may change in the future.

## Design overview.
This project consists of a variety of parts.

1. DIY macrorail system (parts list forthcoming)
2. Canon EOS 3mpx (model number forthcoming)
3. DIY rotating stage with pinch grip
4. relay circuit
5. Arduion Uno
6. OSEPP Motor & Servo Shield
7. USB Cable
8. Controlling Computer
9. Power supply
